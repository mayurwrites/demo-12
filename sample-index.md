# Programming Languages
## Interpreted languages
### Python

**Python** invented in 1994 by __Guido Van Rossum__. It is an _interpreted_ and *typesafe* language[^1].

---
Important features:

- Multiline editing with history preservation.
- ~~structural typing~~
- Prompts and tracebacks with color enabled by default.

Two important steps are:
1. Add `Python` as an environment variable.
2. Source the `.bashrc` file.

\## (Not a heading)

Check the `python` is properly set or not:
```python
print("Hello World")
```

`print` prints any datatype such as `int`, `float`, `string` etc.

> **NOTE**: It is important to note that either use tabs or spaces but not both for indentation to avoid issues with code compilation.
